		<p>It’s for good reason that Dora the Explorer is one of the most popular shows among small children. In addition to the entertaining way it presents its stories, it’s also a space where kids can gain knowledge and learn values.
			<br>
			Here are some of its greatest virtues:
			<br>
		<ol>
			<li>It teaches kids to participate. The show asks them to yell out loud and to help find things. This helps kids understand that their role in the world should be dynamic, not passive.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>It familiarizes kids with a different language. The series originally ran in English, and helps kids learn words in Spanish. In other languages, it makes a similar effort to make them more familiar with English. The show’s method makes it easy for kids to pick up basic words.</li>
			<br>
			<li>It teaches kids about the environment. Nature and animals are two important presences on Dora the Explorer. This helps to broaden the sensibilities of children who live in urban settings.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>The music helps, too. The songs and musical themes are constant throughout the show. These elements help strengthen listening and memory, while also providing a fantastic atmosphere.
